- Need better handling of Notion API rate limits
- Consider adding request ID for tracing
- Webhook signature verification needed for security
- Notion API tokens now use 'ntn_' prefix instead of 'secret_'
- Brand archetypes work well with weighted random selection
- Archetype voice significantly impacts content quality
- System is easily extensible for new archetypes

### Dependencies to Update
- Check for Agency Swarm updates
- Monitor OpenAI API changes
- Keep FastAPI and Pydantic current

### Technical Debt

- Consolidate configuration management
- Improve test coverage for edge cases
- Add performance benchmarks

## üîÑ Task Management Rules
