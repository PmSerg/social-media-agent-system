## Test Structure
- Use appropriate testing framework (Pytest for Python, Jest/Vitest for JS)
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Include descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Coverage Requirements
- Test all public methods/functions
- Include happy path scenarios
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Add error handling tests
- Verify all return types and values

## Best Practices
- Use mocks/stubs for external dependencies
- Keep tests isolated and independent
- Ensure tests are fast and deterministic
- Add setup and teardown when needed
- Include parameterized tests for multiple scenarios

Provide the complete test file with all necessary imports and fixtures.
