Create end-to-end tests for $argument with the following approach:

## E2E Test Scope
- Test complete user workflows from start to finish
- Verify integration between all system components
- Test in production-like environment

## Implementation
- Use appropriate E2E framework (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium)
- Set up test data and environment
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Test critical user paths

## Test Scenarios
- User registration and login flow
- Core business functionality
- Error recovery scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness (if applicable)

## Best Practices
- Use page object pattern for maintainability
- Add explicit waits instead of sleep
- Take screenshots on failures
- Clean up test data after execution
- Make tests independent and repeatable

Provide complete E2E test implementation with all necessary configuration.
