Create integration tests for $argument focusing on:

## Integration Points
- API endpoint testing with real HTTP requests
- Database operations with test database
- External service integrations
- Message queue interactions
- File system operations

## Test Requirements
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between layers
- Check error propagation
- Validate response formats
- Test transaction boundaries

## Implementation Details
- Use test containers for databases
- Mock only external third-party services
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Verify data persistence
- Check concurrent operation handling

## Best Practices
- Use database transactions for cleanup
- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify proper error messages
- Check performance constraints
- Include security validations

Provide integration test suite with proper setup/teardown and test data management.
